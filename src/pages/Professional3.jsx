                A classic, streamlined look well-suited for formal positions at

                Does your dream job require a suit and tie? Dress pants and a
                blazer? Those are good signs that your application requires a
                professional resume. The best
                <a href="simple.html">resume templates</a> are expertly crafted
                with muted color palettes and clean lines to send the message
                that you are a refined candidate with the right decorum and
                experience to get a serious job done.

                    When writing a professional resume for a serious company,
                    it’s important to include only your most relevant professional
                    experience. It’s a good idea to leave off student work or
                    entry-level positions that don’t demonstrate your
                    achievements in the field where you intend to work.

                To get the most out of your professional template, it’s important
                that you maximize the space to include only the most relevant
                details and
                <a

                that will show a potential employer how you can add value to
                their company. Make sure your writing also carries a professional
                tone, and don’t be afraid to ask a friend for help with

              <h2>When to pick a professional resume template</h2>
              <p>
                Let’s say you’re not sure whether a professional resume template
                is right for you. One way to decide is to really get a feel for
                the image of the company. Check out their website and social
                media. Even just the logo can give you a sense of what type of
                workplace you might be dealing with. Does the company strike you
                as prim and proper and more conservative than flashy?
              </p>

                These are good indicators that a professional resume template is
                in line. Professional templates are most often in use in the
                <a href="../resume-examples/administrative.html">administration</a>,
                <a href="../resume-examples/lawyer.html">law</a> and medical
                fields. If the position requires an advanced degree, it’s a good
                bet that you’ll need a professional resume template. However,
                there are other situations that call for these templates as well.
                For example, a recent grad applying as a receptionist for a
                large accounting firm may also benefit from a professional
                resume template.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re still not sure, it’s best to err on the side of caution
                and pick a more formal resume template. Unless you are applying
                to a highly creative company, a professional template with its
                clean color scheme and streamlined design will virtually never
                be out of place. A hiring manager or recruiter will thank you for
                keeping the focus on your

              <h2>What makes a professional resume template</h2>
              <p>
                A professional resume template is characterized by a focus on
                the candidate’s skills and experience. One accent color may be
                used but overall, the emphasis is placed on the text with minimal
                distractions from icons or other flourishes. The resume format
                may have room for a headshot or logo but there should be enough
                white space on the page to effectively balance out large chunks
                of text. Candidates should focus on writing their professional
                experience and summary in a professional tone, using
                <span>strong action verbs</span> that connote leadership and
                competence.
