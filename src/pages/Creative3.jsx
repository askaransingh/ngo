              <h2>When to pick a creative resume template</h2>
              <p>
                Chances are, if you work in a creative field, you’ve already
                been eyeing some creative resume templates. But should you really
                go for such a bold approach? One way to decide is to evaluate
                the brand and company you plan to work for. Do they favor loud
                colors and an informal, direct tone? In that case, a creative
                resume can be a great tool to prove why you’d fit right into
                their workplace.

                Professionals who work in fashion, film, media, marketing,

                <a href="../resume-examples/web-developer.html">web development</a>,
                floral, cosmetology, art or writing may all benefit from a
                creative resume template. Whereas in other industries you may
                have the choice whether or not to go bold, in certain creative
                fields, a strong resume is not only advised, it’s expected. After
                all, a prim and proper image sends the message you haven’t done
                your homework when it comes to being familiar with the company.

                Lastly, even if you're not a creative professional, you may
                choose a creative resume template to stand out from other
                candidates and show that you’re not afraid to be yourself. This
                works best in situations where the company is a creative agency,
                even if your role is not. For example, a
                <a href="../resume-examples/receptionist.html">receptionist</a>
                for a photography studio may use a creative resume to show that
                they appreciate aesthetic touches, even if they are not an
                artist themselves.

              <h2>What makes a creative resume template</h2>
              <p>
                A creative resume template is defined by eye-catching colors
                and daring fonts. A strong block of color at the top of the
                resume draws attention to the candidate’s name and title with
                plenty of white space below for
                <a
                  href="../how-to-write-a-resume/list-skills-on-your-resume.html"
                >
                  skills
                </a>
                and experience. A creative resume template should also
                include space for social media handles or a website where
                potential employers can see a collection of the candidate’s
                work. In some industries and countries, a headshot is required,
                so a creative resume template should include space for that
                possibility.
