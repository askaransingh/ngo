              <h2>When to pick a modern resume template</h2>
              <p>
                Professionals in tech,
                <a href="../resume-examples/it.html">IT</a>,
                <a href="../examples/marketing.html">marketing</a>, design and
                media can all benefit from a modern resume template. A modern
                resume can also work great for startups or in various other
                industries where companies promote themselves as youthful and
                on-trend. A modern resume template helps you match the company’s
                personal style and present yourself as fresh and innovative. If
                you need a more formal or professional look and feel check out
                our
                <a href="professional.html">professional resume templates</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                A modern resume can also help you stand out in the application
                pool. A pop of color and a bold design can keep your name
                swirling in a hiring manager’s mind. Just remember to keep your
                writing fresh and on-point to show what a well-rounded candidate
                you are.
              </p>
              <p>
                We tend to think of the profile summary as the first thing a
                hiring manager sees, but a striking layout is truly the best way
                to make a great first impression. If your field or industry calls
                for a bold approach, don’t hold back! Choose a modern resume
                template to prove you’re the cream of the crop when it comes to
                industry-leading professionals.

              <h2>What makes a modern resume template</h2>
              <p>
                A modern resume template is defined by exciting colors and a
                strong emphasis on the top of the resume. These templates offer
                ample space for a personalized
                <span>profile summary</span> and clever resume formatting to
                include all your most relevant skills. Strong lines lead the
                reader down and across the template so that no section is
                missed. These best
                <a href="../resume-templates.1.html">templates</a>
                <a href="../templates.html"> </a>also contain enough white space
                to keep the resume from feeling cluttered.
