                    Just because your resume template is simple doesn’t mean your
                    resume has to be. In general, it’s best to leave off “obvious”
                    or “expected” skills like MS Word or internet research. Same
                    goes with unrelated, outdated or irrelevant experience.

                While professions involving physical activity and labor can
                benefit from a simple layout, these templates are also great for
                students and those applying to entry-level positions. Before you
                go bold with loud colors and untraditional fonts, you may want to
                test the application pool waters with a simple template that
                keeps the focus on your experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make the most out of your basic template, make sure to keep the
                writing clean and professional. Since you don’t have many pictures
                or colors to catch a recruiter’s eye, you’ll want to use strong
                action verbs that accurately capture your accomplishments. As
                always, proofreading your resume for grammar and spelling errors
                is a must.

              <h2>What makes a simple resume/ CV template</h2>
              <p>
                A simple or basic resume template is defined by a clean and
                consistent look with strong lines separating categories and
                leading the eye through the template. Most of these templates use
                a grayscale color scheme to create a subdued feel where the
                focus is on the actual content of the resume. Compared with other
                types of free templates, simple resumes place more emphasis on
                the body of the resume instead of the top.
